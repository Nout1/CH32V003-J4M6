# Introduction

Many applications use servo motors since they only need one PWM signal to control them.
Here we use the CH32V003-J4M6 MCU to let a servo rotate.
The angle position as well as the speed to move to a new angle are programmable.
Instead of a linear speed in movement, also a logarithmic movement can be used, giving it a more "human" touch.
