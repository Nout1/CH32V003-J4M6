# DEMO projects for CH32V003-J4M6  (SOP8 package)

CH32V003-J4M6 is a tiny 8-pin MCU from WCH, similar to the popular ATTINY13, but offers more power and additional resources at a much lower cost.

Besides an 8-pin version also 16-pin, 20-pin and a 40-pin versions exist, still at a low cost, which add many additional GPIOs and can easy compete with the capabilities of an arduino.
Find much more information on WCH's webpage: https://www.wch-ic.com

Unfortunately not yet many projects exist that use this MCU.

This repository adds a set of additional demos.

# IDE used

I've used the WCH default IDE called Mounriver Studio. It can be found here: http://www.mounriver.com.

Also the Arduino IDE, PlatformIO and other IDEs support this MCU family.
