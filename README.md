# DEMO projects for CH32V003-J4M6  (SOP8 package)

CH32V003-J4M6 is a tiny 8-pin MCU, similar to the popular ATTINY13, but offers more power and additional resources
Besides an 8 pin version also 16-pin, 20-pin and a 40-pin version exists, still at low cost, with add many additional GPIOs and can easy compete with the capabilities of an arduino
Unfortunately not so many projects exist yet that use this MCU
This repository adds a set of additional demos

# IDE used

I've used the WCH default IDE called Mountriver IDE. It can be found here.
Also the Arduino IDE, PlatformIO and other IDEs support this MCU family.
